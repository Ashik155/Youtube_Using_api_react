 We are going to Use basic of props concepts in this project. 
 
 Whole app has all the component Resides in the component directory. 

 Search bar has input field who's value is controlled and coming from the state not from the DOMRef. 
 Input Field has also Onchange Method which will trigger function onInputChange when user types keywords init and hence this function will set the state and our app will re render.
